Here are all the videos you'll likely ever need on the Node JS Event Loop explained.

All three videos below cover the exact same topic in different ways (and different years) so you may only need to watch any one of the three:

1. [Lydia Hallie's 2024 explanation of the Event Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiC58R16hb8)
2. [Philip Roberts' 2014 JSConf explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
3. [Node JS and Deno Creator Ryal Dahl's 2009 JSConf explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVvQhZbCb6c)
